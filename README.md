# Basic Game Idea - "Linda's Math Game"

I want to create a math game for second / third graders. Using a flashcard type system, but with an interesting interface that engages learning.

## Tech Used

* HTML5 & CSS*
* JavaScript


## My MVP

The user will be able to choose whether to play with addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Each one of these choices will have twenty different math problems on "flashcards".

There will be a large message in the beginning that greets the user and there will be button or checkboxes to choose which type of math problem.

The user will have a button to "start". On hover of the mouse over the start button - you will hear Linda Davis' voice saying: "You should do a math game." Then the user will see the first problem.

The game will display math problems and the user will type in the answer *(number)* of the problem displayed on the flash card. The entire page will be fully responsive to different window sizes. With two different breakpoints from the regular window - medium window, small window.

There will be different sound depending on whether the user types in a correct answer.

After the user types in the answer it will either display that the answer was correct or incorrect - then it will ask if they want to see the answer to the question. They can choose to see the answer or not.

Either way, there will be a button to click to move onto the next question.

There will be a point system *( maybe 5 points per question)* where the user can earn 5 points per right answer and will decrement 5 points per wrong question. Once a certain number of points are earned *( maybe 50 points )* the user will win.

There is no "lose" condition - only communicating to the user if their answer is incorrect. 

## Stretch Goals

* To make the entire game bilingual *( english / spanish )*.

* Include sound recording of Linda Davis' voice - reading each math problem - which the user will hear, in addition to seeing the numbers on the screen and the rest of the visual interface.

* Incorporate short, inspirational quotes from various female mathematicians and computer scientists, programmers, venture capitalists - whatever I can find.

* Increase the number of math problems per "choice", multiplication, division, etc.

* Find a way to work with an API of some kind - in some way
